   Create a method that takes user's age (has a parameter for age) and prints out different messages based on the age:
       /*
        if age is less than 16, print "You can't drive."
        if age is less than 18, print "You can't vote."
        if age is less than 25, print "You can't rent a car."
        if age is 25 or over, print "You can do anything that's legal."
